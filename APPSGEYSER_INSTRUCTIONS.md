# JP Hosting - AppsGeyser Instructions

## Step 1: Wait for GitHub Pages Deployment
After pushing this code to GitHub, wait for the GitHub Actions to complete. Your app will be available at:
**https://jaydendpenha.github.io/jp-hosting-minecraft**

## Step 2: Create APK with AppsGeyser
1. Go to [AppsGeyser.com](https://appsgeyser.com)
2. Choose "Website" option
3. Enter the URL: `https://jaydendpenha.github.io/jp-hosting-minecraft`
4. Customize your app:
   - App Name: JP Hosting
   - App Icon: Upload the logo from `client/public/logo192.png`
   - App Description: Minecraft Server Hosting Platform
5. Generate and download your APK

## Step 3: Test Your APK
- Install the APK on your Android device
- The app will load your hosted React application
- All features including login, payments, and server management will work

## Alternative: Using the Package File
If you prefer to use online build services like PhoneGap Build, you can still use the `jp-hosting-apk-package.zip` file that was created earlier. However, AppsGeyser with the live URL is much simpler and faster.

## Note
The app will be fully functional once the GitHub Pages deployment is complete. You can check the deployment status in your GitHub repository's Actions tab.
